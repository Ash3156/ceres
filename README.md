This web app allows users to upload images of the fruit or leaf of one of our common compatible plants, and our neural net identifies what type of disease (if any) the plant has. It then displays all relevant info for that disease. If the image uploaded is not a compatible plant leaf or fruit, our app will instead show an epic Bernie x Psy meme.

To run our app, clone our repository. Then activate a virtual environment with Python verison 3.5 to 3.8 (necessary for compatibility with latest version of Tensorflow). Next cd into Final and run "pip install -r 'requirements.txt' (pip3 on Mac) to install the required libraries in the virtual environment. Lastly, run python app.py, and upload images to your heart's content.
