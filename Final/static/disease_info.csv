Apple Scab,"A serious disease of apples and ornamental crabapples, apple scab (Venturia inaequalis) attacks both leaves and fruit. The fungal disease forms pale yellow or olive-green spots on the upper surface of leaves. Dark, velvety spots may appear on the lower surface. Severely infected leaves become twisted and puckered and may drop early in the summer. Symptoms on fruit are similar to those found on leaves. Scabby spots are sunken and tan and may have velvety spores in the center. As these spots mature, they become larger and turn brown and corky. Infected fruit becomes distorted and may crack allowing entry of secondary organisms. Severely affected fruit may drop, especially when young.","The apple scab fungus (Venturia inaequalis) overwinters in infected leaves that have fallen to the ground. Fruiting bodies are produced within the dead leaf tissue. As spring approaches these begin to mature and produce spores (ascospores; primary phase) that are discharged into air currents and carried to developing apple buds. The fruiting bodies in the fallen leaves must be wet for the spores to discharge. The ascospores are not all discharged with the first spring rains, for they mature over a 4- to 6-week period. This period usually coincides with the time that elapses from ¼ inch green until 2 to 3 weeks after petal fall. Mature ascospores peak from late pink through petal fall, which is the most critical time for protection during the primary phase of the disease. especially if ideal environmental conditions favoring disease are present.",,"Grow scab-resistant cultivars of apples. Apples with good resistance include Akane, Chehalis, Liberty, Prima and Tydeman Red. Apply nitrogen to leaves that have fallen to the ground in the fall to enhance decomposition of fallen leaves and make them more palatable to earthworms. Hand apply a liquid fish solution or 16-16-16 fertilizer to help with the decomposition. Shred fallen leaves in the fall with a mower to help speed up decomposition. Prune your apple trees to open up branching and allow more air circulation. When watering your apple trees, avoid getting foliage wet. Apply dolomitic lime in the fall, after leaf drop, to increase pH and to help reduce fungal spores in the spring. Spray fungicide – Bonide Captan, wettable sulfur, summer lime sulfur or Spectracide Immunox – when temperatures are above 60 degrees and the leaves or blooms are wet.","Fungicides against apple scab can only protect healthy trees from getting infected, they do not get rid of the fungus on an infected tree. Once the tree shows symptoms of the disease during the growing season, spraying a fungicide won’t have any effect. All that a fungicide does is create a protective coating so that the spores that land on the leaves or fruit cannot become active, thereby breaking the disease cycle on the tree.
Don’t apply indiscriminately a fungicide as a preventative measure on all your apple or crabapple trees, but only spray a tree that has been infected by the fungus. Again, the rule of thumb is if the tree has lost its leaves prematurely for three consecutive years.
Timing is key. Spray when the bud growth starts, and repeat with the frequency and in the intervals specified on the fungicide label. When and how often to apply a fungicide also depends on the weather conditions, and the severity of the infection. Before you spray again, always thoroughly inspect the leaves for symptoms to decide whether another application of the fungicide is indeed necessary.
There are different types of fungicides for eating apples and crabapples so make sure the fungicide is suitable for eating apples. Fungicides available to homeowners are products with captan, lime-sulfur, and dusting wettable sulfur as active ingredients."
Apple Black Rot,"Early symptoms are often limited to leaf symptoms such as purple spots on upper leaf surfaces. As these spots age, the margins remain purple, but the centers dry out and turn yellow to brown. Over time, the spots expand and heavily infected leaves drop from the tree. Infected branches or limbs will show characteristic red-brown sunken areas that expand each year. Fruit infection is the most destructive form of this pathogen and begins with infected flowers before fruits expand. When fruits are tiny and green, you’ll notice red flecks or purplish pimples that enlarge as the fruit does. Mature fruit lesions take on a bulls-eye appearance, with bands of brown and black areas expanding outward from a central point in each lesion. Commonly, black rot disease causes blossom end rot or mummification of the fruits on the tree.

",,,,"Treating black rot on apple trees starts with sanitation. Because fungal spores overwinter on fallen leaves, mummified fruits, dead bark, and cankers, it’s important to keep all the fallen debris and dead fruit cleaned up and away from the tree. During the winter, check for red cankers and remove them by cutting them out or pruning away the affected limbs at least six inches (15 cm.) beyond the wound. Destroy all infected tissue immediately and keep a watchful eye out for new signs of infection. Once black rot disease is under control in your tree and you’re again harvesting healthy fruits, make sure to remove any injured or insect-invaded fruits to avoid re-infection. Although general-purpose fungicides, like copper-based sprays and lime sulfur, can be used to control black rot, nothing will improve apple black rot like removing all sources of spores.

Apple Cedar Apple Rust,"On the apple tree, the infections occur on leaves, fruit and young twigs.[2] The brightly colored spots produced on the leaves make it easy to identify. Small, pale yellow spots appear on the upper surfaces of the leaves, usually during late April or May on the eastern seaboard of the United States. These spots gradually enlarge and turn orange or red and may show concentric rings of color. Drops of orange liquid may be visible on the spots. Later in the season, black dots appear on the orange spots on the upper leaf surface. In late summer, tube-like structures develop on the undersurface of the apple leaf. Infected leaves sometimes drop prematurely, particularly during drought conditions or when the tree is under additional stress. Infections on fruit are usually near the blossom end and are somewhat similar to the leaf lesions.","Cedar apple rust is caused by the fungi Gymnosporangium or more specifically Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae that spend part of their life cycles on Eastern Red Cedars growing near orchards. On the eastern seaboard of the United States, at the first warm rain of spring, the spore horns become gelatinous masses and produce their teliospores.",,"The best way to control cedar apple rust is to prevent infection using a mixture of cultural methods and chemical treatments. If you see the lesions on the apple leaves or fruit, it is too late to control the fungus. In that case, you should focus on purging infected leaves and fruit from around your tree. If your tree has a history of infection with cedar apple rust, you will want to get ahead of the infection and take preemptive measures. This is critical in the spring, when the juniper galls are releasing their spores. The time to treat your tree is between the pink stage of the blossoms (when the leaves are turning green) to the period when the petals drop. The most effective types of fungicides to use are those that inhibit fungal sterols. They are known as “SI,” or sterol inhibitors.

","If you see the lesions on the apple leaves or fruit, it is too late to control the fungus. In that case, you should focus on purging infected leaves and fruit from around your tree. Spraying apple trees with copper can be done to treat cedar apple rust and prevent other fungal infections."

Cherry Powdery Mildew,"Initial symptoms, often occurring 7 to 10 days after the onset of the first irrigation, are light roughly-circular, powdery looking patches on young, susceptible leaves (newly unfolded, and light green expanding leaves). Older leaves develop an age-related (ontogenic) resistance to powdery mildew and are naturally more resistant to infection than younger leaves. Look for early leaf infections on root suckers, the interior of the canopy or the crotch of the tree where humidity is high. In contrast to other fungi, powdery mildews do not need free water to germinate but germination and fungal growth are favored by high humidity (Grove & Boal, 1991a). The disease is more likely to initiate on the undersides (abaxial) of leaves (Fig. 2) but will occur on both sides at later stages. As the season progresses and infection is spread by wind, leaves may become distorted, curling upward. Severe infections may cause leaves to pucker and twist. Newly developed leaves on new shoots become progressively smaller, are often pale and may be distorted.","Powdery mildew fungi can only reproduce on their living cell host and reproduce both sexually and asexually. Sexual reproduction is via chasmothecia (formerly cleistothecium), a type of ascocarp where the genetic material recombines. Powdery mildew fungi must be adapted to their hosts to be able to infect them. Within each ascocarp are several asci.

Under optimal conditions, ascospores mature and are released to initiate new infections. Conditions necessary for spore maturation differ among species. Asexual reproduction is where the mother fungi and offspring are genetically identical. Powder mildew fungi offspring of wheat and barley species are more successful from asexual reproduction compared to sexual reproduction counterparts.","","Milk has long been popular with home gardeners and small-scale organic growers as a treatment for powdery mildew. Milk is diluted with water (typically 1:10) and sprayed on susceptible plants at the first sign of infection, or as a preventative measure, with repeated weekly application often controlling or eliminating the disease. Studies have shown milk's effectiveness as comparable to some conventional fungicides, and better than benomyl and fenarimol at higher concentrations. Milk has proven effective in treating powdery mildew of summer squash, pumpkins, grapes, and roses. The exact mechanism of action is unknown, but one known effect is that ferroglobulin, a protein in whey, produces oxygen radicals when exposed to sunlight, and contact with these radicals is damaging to the fungus.

Dilute sprays containing sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and vegetable or mineral oils in water are often recommended for controlling powdery mildew, but such mixtures have limited and inconsistent efficacy. While sodium bicarbonate has been shown to reduce to growth of mildews in lab tests, sprays containing only baking soda and water are not effective in controlling fungal diseases on infected plants, and high concentrations of sodium are harmful to plants.

","In an agricultural setting, the pathogen can be controlled using chemical methods, genetic resistance, and careful farming methods. Standard fungicides are an effective way to manage powdery mildew disease on plants. Spray programs of conventional fungicides are advised to begin when powdery mildew symptoms and signs are first noticed. Conventional fungicides should be applied on a regular basis for best results against the disease. Control is possible with triadimefon and propiconazole. It is also possible with hexaconazole, myclobutanil, and penconazole. There are some unconventional chemical control methods that offer alternative modes of action. The most effective non-conventional methods of chemical control against powdery mildew are milk, natural sulfur (S8), potassium bicarbonate, metal salts, and oils."

Corn Gray Leaf Spot,"The initial symptoms of grey leaf spot emerge as small, dark, moist spots that are encircled by a thin, yellow radiance (lesions forming). The tissue within the “spot"" begins to die as spot size increases into longer, narrower leaf lesions. Although initially brownish and yellow, the characteristic grey color that follows is due to the production of grey fungal spores (conidia) on the lesion surface. These symptoms that are similar in shape, size and discoloration, are also prevalent on the corn husks and leaf sheaths. Leaf sheath lesions are not surrounded by a yellow radiance, rather a brown or dark purple radiance.[9] This dark brown or purple discoloration on leaf sheaths is also characteristic to northern corn leaf blight (Exserohilum turcicum), southern corn leaf blight (Bipolaris maydis), or northern corn leaf spot (Bipolaris zeicola). Corn grey leaf spot mature lesions are easily diagnosed and distinguishable from these other diseases. Mature corn grey leaf spot lesions have brown rectangular and vein limited shape. Secondary and tertiary leaf veins limit the width of the lesion and sometimes individual lesions can combine to blight entire leaves.","Cercospora zeae-maydis survives only as long as infected corn debris is present; however, it is a poor soil competitor. The debris on the soil surface is a cause for primary inoculation that infects the incoming corn crop for the next season. By late spring, conidia (asexual spores) are produced by Cercospora zeae-maydis in the debris through wind dispersal or rain. The conidia are disseminated and eventually infect new corn crop.[13] In order for the pathogen to actually infect the host, high relative humidity and moisture (dew) on the leaves are necessary for inoculation. Primary inoculation occurs on lower regions of younger leaves, where conidia germinate across leaf surfaces and penetrate through stomata via a flattened hyphal organ, an appressorium. Cercospora zeae-maydis is atypical in that its conidia can grow and survive for days before penetration, unlike most spores that need to penetrate within hours to ensure survival. Once infection occurs, the conidia are produced in these lower leaf regions. Assuming favorable weather conditions (see Environment Section), these conidia serve as secondary inoculum for upper leaf regions, as well as husks and sheaths (where it can also overwinter and produce conidia the following season). Additionally, wind and heavy rains tend to disperse the conidia during many secondary cycles to other parts of the field causing more secondary cycles of infection. If conditions are unfavorable for inoculation, the pathogen undergoes a state of dormancy during the winter season and reactivates when conditions favorable to inoculation return (moist, humid) the following season. The fungus overwinters as stromata (mixture of plant tissues and fungal mycelium) in leaf debris, which give rise to conidia causing primary inoculations the following spring and summer.[14]

",,"In order to best prevent and manage corn grey leaf spot, the overall approach is to reduce the rate of disease growth and expansion. This is done by limiting the amount of secondary disease cycles and protecting leaf area from damage until after corn grain formation. High risks for corn grey leaf spot are divided into eight factors, which require specific management strategies. High risk factors for grey leaf spot in corn:
Susceptible hybrid
Continuous corn
Late planting date
Minimum tillage systems
Field history of severe disease
Early disease activity (before tasseling)
Irrigation
Favorable weather forecast for disease
There are currently five different management strategies, some of which are more effective than others.

The most proficient and economical method to reduce yield losses from corn grey leaf spot is by introducing resistant plant varieties. In places where leaf spot occur, these crops can ultimately grow and still be resistant to the disease. Although the disease is not completely eliminated and resistant varieties show disease symptoms, at the end of the growing season, the disease is not as effective in reducing crop yield. SC 407 have been proven to be common corn variety that are resistant to grey leaf spot. If grey leaf spot infection is high, this variety may require fungicide application to achieve full potential. Susceptible varieties should not be planted in previously infected areas (see high risk table).

","Fungicides are available for in-season gray leaf spot management. It is important to remember that a fungicide application is an additional cost to corn production, so growers must consider economic factors (corn market
price and fungicide application cost) and other disease factors before deciding whether to apply a fungicide to manage gray leaf spot. Research in Indiana indicates that strobilurin and strobilurin/triazole premix fungicides are most effective at preventing yield loss when applied in response to disease presence, and at the tasseling to early silking (VT-R1) growth stage. Scouting fields around V14, or just prior to tassel emergence, can help determine the level of disease pressure in a field."
Corn Common Rust,"Puccinia sorghi often first appears after silking in maize. The first early symptom includes chlorotic specks on the leaf. The obvious sign of this plant pathogen is golden-brown pustules or bumps on the above-ground surface of the plant tissue.[5] These bumps are urediniospores which can spread to other plants and cause further infection. They are circular and powdery, which result from spores breaking through the leaf surface. While they are only about 1-2 mm each, they are very numerous with equal frequencies on upper and lower leaf surfaces. Overtime, these blister-like bumps can change from brown to black, changing from urediniospores to teliospores. [6] The most common place to find these spores is on the plant leaf, but they can develop on husks, tassels, and stalks as well. P. sorghi has two hosts making it a heteroecious rust. Maize and Oxalis are the two hosts for P. sorghi. In comparison, the other common type of maize rust is southern corn rust (Puccinia polysora) and it has a higher variety of hosts including maize, silver plumegrass, eastern gamagrass, Tripsacum lanceolatum, T. laxum, and T. pilorum.[6]","There are five spore stages in P. sorghi. The spore types are teliospores, basidiospores, pycniospores, aeciospores, and urediniospores. Every year, viable urediniospores must travel to the north from the warmer southern climate. Since P. sorghi is an obligate parasite, it requires living plant tissue in order to survive. Therefore, this disease cannot overwinter in northern US states. The severity of the disease depends largely on weather conditions and how many spores are carried north each season.[7] Urediniospores infect leaves and produce more spores to create a secondary inoculum and polycyclic disease cycle. Once the urediniospores mature on the plant tissue and turn black they become teliospores. Urediniospores measure 22-33 × 20-28 µm. Teliospores are two-celled and measure 27-53 µm.[8] Teliospores overwinter in the southern climate and germinate in the spring. Teliospores produce basidiospores which spread by wind to infect Oxalis. They infect Oxalis and produce sexual spores (pycniospores) and aeciospores. Aeciospores are windblown to maize and infect the plant.

",,"The use of resistant maize hybrids is the best way to manage P. sorghi. There are two types of resistance that exist.[9] The first is partial resistance which results in fewer rust spots by reducing germination rate. This type of resistance makes P. sorghi less severe by slowing down development of number of urediniospores. The other type of resistance is qualitative. This type relies on a single gene which provides total resistance to the plant. Other management tactics include foliar application of fungicide and cultural control.[10] For fungicide application, plants should be monitored throughout the season, spraying when there are six or more pustules per leaf. Fungicide groups that can be used include mixed modes of action, DMI Triazoles (Group 3), and Qol Strobilurins (Group 11).[11] Cultural control can be more effective in areas where the spores can overwinter. Debris should be collected and destroyed by burning along with eradication of Oxalis in surrounding areas. In northern areas where the spores can’t overwinter, early planting time can help avoid P. sorghi. Younger leaves are more susceptible to infection, by planting earlier the crop will be more mature and more resilient by the time the spores arrive.",
Corn Northern Leaf Blight,"Lesions can eventually expand to a more oblong or “cigar” shape. They may also coalesce to form large areas of necrotic tissue.

There are several host-specific forms of E. turcicum. The most economically important host is corn, but other forms may infect sorghum, Johnson grass, or sudangrass.[2] The most common diagnostic symptom of the disease on corn is cigar-shaped or elliptical necrotic gray-green lesions on the leaves that range from one to seven inches long.[3] These lesions may first appear as narrow, tan streaks that run parallel to the leaf veins. Fully developed lesions typically have a sooty appearance during humid weather, as a result of spore (conidia) formation. As the disease progresses, the lesions grow together and create large areas of dead leaf tissue. The lesions found in Northern corn leaf blight are more acute if the leaves above the ear are infected during or soon after flowering of the plant.[4] In susceptible corn hybrids, lesions are also found on the husk of ears or leaf sheaths. In partially resistant hybrids, these lesions tend to be smaller due to reduced spore formation. In highly resistant hybrids, the only visible disease symptoms may be minute yellow spots.[5]

On severely infected plants, lesions can become so numerous that the leaves are eventually destroyed. Late in the season, plants may look like they have been killed by an early frost. Lesions on products containing resistance genes may appear as long, chlorotic, streaks, which can be mistaken for Stewart’s wilt or Goss's wilt.","In nature, E. turcicum lives and reproduces in an asexual phase with a relatively simple life cycle. In temperate regions, the fungus overwinters mycelia, conidia, and chlamydospores in the infected corn debris.[2] When conditions become favorable the following season, conidia are produced from the debris and dispersed by rain or wind to infect new, healthy corn plants.[5] Once on a leaf, conidia will germinate and directly infect the plant. The damage to the plant is relatively localized, although diseased corn plants are more susceptible to stalk rot than are healthy plants.[2] In conditions with high humidity, the fungus will produce new spores at the leaf surface, which are spread by rain or wind through the crop and create cycles of secondary infection.[5] One complete cycle on susceptible plants takes approximately 10 to 14 days, whereas it takes about 20 days on plants with resistance.[2] At the end of the season, E. turcicum goes into a state of dormancy in crop residue.

",,"Preventative management strategies can reduce economic losses from NCLB. Preventative management is especially important for fields at high risk for disease development. In-season disease management options, such as fungicides, are also available.

Management of NCLB can be achieved primarily by using hybrids with resistance, but because resistance may not be complete or may fail, it is advantageous to utilize an integrated approach with different cropping practices and fungicides. Scouting fields and monitoring local conditions is vital to control this disease.[5]

Major (vertical) resistance of corn hybrids comes from the race specific Ht1, Ht2, Ht3, and HtN genes, with the Ht1 gene being most prevalent. Plants with Ht1 Ht2, or Ht3 genes have smaller, chlorotic lesions and reduced sporulation.[2] The HtN gene delays symptoms until after the pollen shed. Individually, each Ht gene has limited effectiveness because there are races of E. turcicum that are virulent in the presence of one or the other. For example, widespread use of the Ht1 gene has reduced the prevalence of the Race 0 to which it has resistance against, but has increased Race 1. Breeders are now focusing on incorporating several resistance genes into corn hybrids. Incorporating both the Ht1 and Ht2 provide resistance against both Races 0 and 1. Thus far, this multigenic approach has proven to be effective. However resistant plants still show some symptoms, and the threat of new races showing up lends to the need for other management practices, especially in areas where the disease is present.[9]

Ways to change cropping practices to control the disease include reducing the amount of infected residue left in a field, managing weeds to improve airflow and reduce humidity, and encouraging residue decomposition with tillage. The tillage will assist in breaking down crop debris and reducing existing inoculum. In a system with normal tillage, a one-year rotation out of corn can be effective, but a two-year rotation may be required for a reduced-tillage system. If possible, planting in low areas that receive heavy dew and fog should be avoided.[5] A combination of crop rotation for one to two years followed by tillage is recommended to prevent NCLB disease development.[10]

The use of foliar fungicides for corn have also been shown to control NCLB.[5] Research suggests that using fungicides to keep the upper 75% of the leaf canopy disease-free for three quarters of the grain-filling period will eliminate yield loss [11] To ensure that newly emerging leaf tissue is protected from infection, before the plants are in tassel, fungicides should be applied on the same day that significant conidial dispersal is expected to occur. After tasseling and silking, timing becomes less important since plant expansion will have slowed down.[12] The disease pressure in the field and weather conditions should be monitored and evaluated beforehand to determine if fungicides are needed or not.[5]

Grape Black Rot,"Relatively small, brown circular lesions develop on infected leaves and within a few days tiny black spherical fruiting bodies (pycnidia) protrude from them. Elongated black lesions on the petiole may eventually girdle these organs, causing the affected leaves to wilt. Shoot infection results in large black elliptical lesions. These lesions may contribute to breakage of shoots by wind, or in severe cases, may girdle and kill young shoots altogether. This fungus bides its time. Most plants show very little signs of infection until its too late. They will look very healthy until fruit sets. Even flowering will be normal. [1]

Infection of the fruit is the most serious phase of the disease and may result in substantial economic loss. Infected berries first appear light or chocolate brown; it will have a spot that looks very round, like the eye of a bird. That spot will get larger and infect more of the fruit bunch and more of the plant. This creates masses of black pycnidia developing on the surface. Finally, infected berries shrivel and turn into hard black raisin-like bodies that are called mummies.[1]


","The disease cycle begins with the overwintering structures. The grape black rot pathogen overwinters in many parts of the grape vine, especially mummies and lesions, and is able to overwinter on the vineyard floor.[3] In fact, ""Viable lesions capable of producing conidia can persist in wood for at least 2 years.""[4] Spring rains release the ascospores and conidia contained in the overwintering structures and these spores are “spread by wind and rain‐splash to infect leaves, blossoms and young fruit”.[5] Some of the mummies on the ground can have a significant discharge of ascospores that begins about two to three weeks after bud breaks and will mature one to two weeks after the start of bloom.[1] In the presence of moisture, these ascospores germinate slowly, taking 36 to 48 hours, but eventually penetrate the young leaves and fruit stems (pedicels). The infections become visible after 8 to 25 days. The period that overwintering spores require to cause infection depends on the inoculum source. If there is a large source of inoculum, the infection will set in earlier. The second type of spore, conidia, “are dispersed short distances (inches to feet) by splashing rain drops"" in rain storms throughout the summer.[1] Infection occurs when either of the two spore types lands on green grape tissue and the tissue remains wet for a ""sufficient length of time, which is dependent on temperature.""[1] For example, at 45°F no infection will occur regardless of moisture, while at 50°F it takes 24 hours of leaf wetness for a spore to germinate and infect the green grape tissue.[4] When a leaf or berry becomes infected, pycnidia form and produce conidia, contributing to repeated cycles of infections in summer rains.[6] At the end of the season, the fungus overwinters as pycnidia or pseudothecia within cane lesions or mummifed fruit.[6] In the spring, the pycnidia will produce conidia once again and the pseudothecia produce ascospores.[6]  

",,"A mixture of cultural and chemical control practices can manage grape black rot disease caused by Guignardia bidwellii. Cultural control aspects involve the basics in plant care and field sanitation as well as cleanup after an infectious outbreak. Chemical control has a large influence to prevent but not eliminate disease. Cultural control consists of the management of the fields and sanitation methods to optimally grow grape crops. Many universities and professors suggest the following cultural control practices:

The first cultural control method is to choose the right grape cultivar for the region that the grape will be grown in. Grape cultivars differ in their susceptibility to diseases, including differences in the disease black rot. Some varieties are less susceptible, while others are more prone to the disease when the right environmental conditions occur. Through research, many lists of grapes varieties will show the amount of resistance a variety has to disease and how the variety should be grown. A list of grape varieties is a good place to start for selecting the right grape variety.

Proper grape management in the field is important to control black rot disease. The placement of the grape plants is important to provide for proper aeration and lighting. “Choose a planting site where the vines will be exposed to full sun and good air circulation.”[2] Proper training of grape vines should be practiced. Many people use trellising to keep the vines off the ground. Trellising is a form of plant training, which is the arrangement of plant parts spatially to optimize productivity. Having the grape vines off the ground “reduces the time that vines remain wet from dew and rain and thus limits the amount of infection”.[2] As the current seasons growth occurs, tie the new growth in a spatial manner to allow for air circulation and sunlight to affect the whole grape plant.

A proper pruning technique is another cultural control method to limit diseases. Prune each vine every year during the dormant period. This dormant pruning is heavily researched to provide the term-balanced pruning. This is done by using the weight of the previous year’s cane growth (1- yr-old canes) to determine how many buds should be retained for the current production year. Up to four pounds of pruning can occur during the season. Remove excess growth, diseased and overwintering berries, leaves, and tendrils from the vineyard, and burn or otherwise destroy them.[2] This practice reduces inoculum of the fungus, thus limiting disease. During the season, minor pruning to train the canopy growth may occur to help with aeration.

The last cultural control method would be to maintain clean fields once infected. Keep the field well managed, do not allow overgrowth of weeds or plants near the grapes. Once the plants have been infected “Remove all mummies from the canopy during the dormant pruning process. Mummies produce spores next to the susceptible grapevine tissues throughout the season; even relatively few can cause significant damage.”[7] Another technique to rid of infection can be to “cultivate the vineyard before bud-break to bury the mummified berries. Diseased berries covered with soil do not produce spores that will reach the developing vines”.[2]


The use of chemical control is widely available for agricultural purposes. To apply chemical applications, look at the fungicide label for proper use. Be sure that the conditions are optimal to spray to avoid drift and inefficiencies of the fungicide due to application. Fungicide guidelines must be followed. There are a wide variety of chemicals that are available for both regular and organic growers.

Commercially, application of fungicides may be costly. To cut down on costs, one must understand the life cycle of the pathogens. Different fungicides are more effective at certain infection stages. Understand that throughout the development of the plant, different fungicides should be considered to protect plant health. In order to cut down on spraying costs, it is important to understand life cycle of the pathogen. “Research in New York demonstrated berries of most varieties become resistant to black rot infection 3-4 weeks after bloom, therefore, sprays for black rot should not be needed at this time”.[7] Understanding times to limit application is important for good production practices. This shows that preventative chemical measures before the three to four weeks would be optimal. Each region should develop their own fungicide application program in correlation with cultural practices.

The most common fungicides that prove to be excellent for certain regions of the United States for controlling black rot are Sovran 50WG, Flint 50WG, Abound Flowable (2.08F), and Pristine 38WDG. Some of these fungicides may only be available for commercial use, however homeowners may go to a hardware store or fungicide distributor for similar fungicides.

Sovran 50WG is registered for control of black rot. The Sovran label gives different use rates for control of different diseases. For black rot the rate is 3.2-4.8 oz/A. Sovran is excellent for control of black rot.[7]

Flint 50WG is in the same general class of chemistry as Abound and Sovran. It is registered for the control of black rot, powdery mildew and suppression of downy mildew. For black rot the rate is 2.0 oz/A.[7]

Abound is in the same general class of chemistry as Sovran and Flint (strobilurin). Abound is recommended at the rate of 11-15.4 fl oz/A. In university tests, the rate of 11-12 fl oz provided good control of the mentioned diseases above. Abound Flowable is very phototoxic to apples of the variety McIntosh or varieties related. Do not allow spray to drift from grapes to apples. [7]

Pristine 38WDG contains a combination of two active ingredients (pyraclostrobin, 12.8% and boscalid 25.2%).Pyraclostrobin, a strobilurin, is in the same general class of chemicals as Abound, Sovran, and Flint (strobilurin Pristine is registered for use at the rates of 6-10.5 oz/A. A maximum of six applications may be made per season). The label states, “Do not use on Concord, Worden, Fredonia, or related varieties due to possible foliar injury. Experience in New York suggests that Corot noir and Noiret may also be sensitive to Pristine.”[7]

Black Rot Control for Organic Growers

Excerpt from Dr. Wayne Wilcox’s Grape Disease Notes, 2009 suggests a possible way for controlling black rot on grapes in organic farming.

Black rot is probably the “Achilles heel” for organic grape production in the East. In the only good trial that we’ve run with copper, it provided 40% disease control when applied at 2-week intervals, versus essentially 100% control with Nova. To try to avoid this, implement a rigorous program to remove mummies during pruning, and spray copper once a week throughout much of the growing season. This was hard on some of the hybrid vines and runs counter to the thinking of many with a “sustainable” orientation (after all, copper is an element and doesn’t break down into anything else, so it stays in the soil forever), but it did control the disease in an organically acceptable manner. Limit inoculum within the vineyard. Ideally, this would include removing or burying any mummies that you might encounter at the site. All mummified clusters should be removed from the trellis during pruning and from 2 to 6 weeks after cap fall and prune out any affected clusters before they allow the disease to spread, all the better (spores for disease spread are dispersed by rain primarily within the canopy, so should pose little risk of causing new infections if said clusters are simply dropped to the ground).",
Grape Black Measles,"During the season, the spots may coalesce over the skin surface, making berries black in appearance. Spotting can develop anytime between fruit set and a few days prior to harvest. Berries affected at fruit set tend not to mature and will shrivel and dry up. In addition to spotting, fruit affected later in the season will also have an acrid taste.

","Recently, two genera of fungi have been implicated as the cause of measles and grapevine decline, a disease that affects young vineyards.",,"Presently, there are no effective management strategies for measles. Wine grape growers with small vineyards will often have field crews remove infected fruit prior to harvest. Raisins affected by measles will be discarded during harvest or at the packing house, while table grape growers will leave affected fruit on the vine. Current research is focused on protecting pruning wounds from fungal infections to minimize suspect fungi from colonizing fresh wounds.",
Grape Leaf Blight,On leaf surface we will see lesions which are irregularly shaped (2 to 25 mm in diameter). Initially lesions are dull red to brown in color turn black later. If disease is severe this lesions may coalesce. On berries we can see symptom similar to black rot but the entire clusters will collapse.,,,"Fungicides sprayed for other diseases in the season may help to reduce this disease.

Orange Huanglongbing,"HLB is distinguished by the common symptoms of yellowing of the veins and adjacent tissues; followed by splotchy mottling of the entire leaf, premature defoliation, dieback of twigs, decay of feeder rootlets and lateral roots, and decline in vigor, ultimately followed by the death of the entire plant. Affected trees have stunted growth, bear multiple off-season flowers (most of which fall off), and produce small, irregularly shaped fruit with a thick, pale peel that remains green at the bottom and tastes very bitter.[5] Common symptoms can often be mistaken for nutrient deficiencies; however, the distinguishing factor between nutrient deficiencies is the pattern of symmetry. Nutrient deficiencies tend to be symmetrical along the leaf vein margin, while HLB has an asymmetrical yellowing around the vein. The most noticeable symptom of HLB is greening and stunting of the fruit, especially after ripening.","HLB was originally thought to be a viral disease, but was later discovered to be caused by bacteria, carried by insect vectors. HLB infection can arise in various climates and is often associated with different species of psyllid insects.[7] For example, citrus crops in Africa become infected under cool conditions as the bacteria are transmitted by the African citrus psyllid Trioza erytreae,[8] an invasive insect that favors cool and moist conditions for optimal growth. Citrus crops in Asia, however, are often infected under warm conditions as the bacteria are transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri.[9][10]

The young larval stage is the most suitable for acquisition of Ca. L. asiaticus by the Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri,[10] and some cultivars show greater efficiency in transmitting the disease to the vector than others.[11] Temperature also shows a great influence in the parasite-host relationship between the bacteria and the insect vector, affecting how it is acquired and transmitted by the insects.[11]

The causative agents are fastidious phloem-restricted, Gram-negative bacteria in the gracilicutes clade. The Asian form, Ca. L. asiaticus is heat tolerant. This means the greening symptoms can develop at temperatures up to 35 °C. The African form, Ca. L. africanus, and American form, Ca. L. americanus, are heat sensitive, thus symptoms only develop when the temperature is in the range 20–25 °C.[12] Although T. erytreae is the natural vector of African citrus greening and D. citri is the natural vector of American and Asian citrus greening, either psyllid can in fact transmit either of the greening agents under experimental conditions.[13]

",,"Some cultural practices can be effective in monitoring this disease. Cultural methods include antibacterial management, sanitation, removal of infected plants, frequent scouting, and most importantly, crisis declaration.[24] Tracking the disease will help prevent further infection in other affected areas and help mitigate more local infections if detected early enough. The Asian citrus psyllid has alternative hosts that may attract psyllids to citrus plants in the vicinity such as Murraya paniculata, Severinia buxifolia, and other plants in the family Rutaceae.[25]

No cure for citrus greening disease is known, and efforts to control it have been slow because infected citrus plants are difficult to maintain, regenerate, and study. Ongoing challenges associated with mitigating disease at the field-scale include seasonality of the phytopathogen (Candidatus Liberibacter spp.) and associated disease symptoms, limitations for therapeutics to contact the phytopathogen in planta, adverse impacts of broad-spectrum treatments on plant-beneficial microbiota, and potential implications on public and ecosystem health.[26]

No naturally immune citrus cultivars have been identified; however, creating genetically modified citrus may be a possible solution, but questions of its acceptability to consumers exist.[27] A researcher at Texas AgriLife Research reported in 2012 that incorporating two genes from spinach into citrus trees improved resistance to citrus greening disease in greenhouse trials.[28] Field tests by Southern Gardens Citrus of oranges with the spinach genes in Florida are ongoing.[27]

A resistant variety of mandarin orange called 'Bingo' has been bred at the University of Florida.[29] Other varieties can have a partial tolerance to the disease.[30]

Antibiotics
Researchers at the Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture have used lemon trees infected with citrus greening disease to infect periwinkle plants in an effort to study the disease. Periwinkle plants are easily infected with the disease and respond well when experimentally treated with antibiotics. Researchers are testing the effect of penicillin G sodium and biocide 2,2-dibromo-3-nitrilopropionamide as potential treatments for infected citrus plants based on the positive results that were observed when applied to infected periwinkle.[31] In June 2014, the USDA allocated an additional US$31.5 million to expand research combating citrus greening disease.[32]

Certain antibiotics, specifically streptomycin and oxytetracycline, may be effective in the fight against citrus greening disease and have been used in the United States but have been banned in Brazil and the European Union.[33] In 2016, the EPA allowed use of streptomycin and oxytetracyclin on orchards with citrus fruits like grapefruits, oranges and tangerines in Florida on an emergency basis, this approval was expanded and broadened to other states for oxytetracycline in December 2018.[33][34] Further expansion of medically important antibiotics is proposed by the EPA but opposed by the FDA and CDC, primarily as antibiotic resistance can be expected to develop and impact human health.[33][34]

Peptide
University of California Riverside announced that geneticist Hailing Jin discovered a peptide capable of treating citrus greening disease. The university entered into an exclusive license with Invaio to develop an enhanced injectable version of the product.[35]

Peach Bacterial Spot,"The symptoms of bacterial spot are quite different from other diseases of stone fruits. They may be confused with nitrogen deficiency and spray injury. The disease first appears as small, water-soaked, grayish areas on leaves. Later the spots become angular and purple, black, or brown in color; the lesions always are delineated by the leaf veins. The mature spots remain angular and are most numerous at the tip ends and along the midribs of leaves. The infected areas may drop out, giving the infected leaves a shot hole, tattered appearance. On plum, the shot-hole effect is more pronounced than on other stone fruits. Infected leaves eventually turn yellow and drop. Severe defoliation often results in reduced fruit size and increased sunburn and fruit cracking. As a result, tree vigor and winter hardiness are also reduced. Other leaf spot diseases and spots due to spray injury tend to be much more circular in outline. These spots can vary in size; from pin-prick to larger depending on the size of the water droplet. These typically are not confined by veins in the leaf as is bacterial spot.","The bacterial spot pathogen overwinters in association with buds, in protected areas on the woody surface of the tree (e.g., cracks in the bark), and in leaf scars that become infected during leaf drop the previous season.",,"In late winter as temperatures are above 65°F, leaf and flower buds swell, new tissue emerges, and the bacteria begin to multiply. The bacteria are spread from cankers by dripping dew and in splashing and/or wind-blown rain to the newly emerging leaves. Bacteria can also infect through natural openings or wounds. High-moisture conditions are very favorable for both leaf and fruit infections. Leaf infections can occur for at least as long as terminal growth and leaf emergence continues. Severe fruit infections are more common when frequent periods of rainfall or even extended heavy dews and very high humidity occur from late bloom to near pit-hardening. Bacterial spot is more severe in areas where peaches are grown in light, sandy soils and disease is more severe on stressed trees. Wind and wind-blown sand can increase the severity of bacterial spot by creating wounds for the bacteria to infect.","Bacterial spot is very difficult to control on highly susceptible cultivars. Under optimal environmental conditions for disease development, control can be difficult even on moderately susceptible cultivars. Control and management measures must be applied preventatively to successfully reduce losses from this disease. Once bacterial spot symptoms are observed, it is almost impossible to bring the disease under control if environmental conditions remain favorable. Environmental conditions that favor bacterial spot development include heavy rain events when temperatures are above 75°F. Extended periods of hot, dry weather reduce the threat of the disease. Planting resistant cultivars is the most effective control measure. An increasing number of good peach cultivars are highly resistant to bacterial spot. Resistance in plums, nectarines, and apricots is not as common. Most, if not all, cultivars developed west of the Rocky Mountains are highly susceptible because they are bred in an environment unsuitable for disease development. Many of the new low-acid white and yellow stone fruit cultivars are highly susceptible to bacterial spot infection. Check with the nursery on the bacterial spot susceptibility before purchasing and planting new stone fruit cultivars. Major outbreaks of bacterial spot in young orchards are often attributed to poor cultural practices. Trees in poor vigor are more susceptible, so orchard management programs should be designed to maintain good vigor. High populations of ring nematode have also been associated with increased bacterial spot, which may be related to stress caused by the nematodes. Minimize blowing sand and/or soil particles within and surrounding the orchard by employing appropriate ground covers and/or by use of appropriately placed windbreaks to blunt the damaging effects of strong winds while still allowing for air movement through the orchard. There are no completely successful spray programs for control of bacterial spot. Chemical sprays with copper-based bactericide and the antibiotic oxytetracycline have moderate efficacy but must be used preventatively. Copper-based sprays are applied from dormant to shuck-split phenology stages to reduce initial inoculum. Because of high sensitivity of peach foliage to copper, rates are reduced progressively in successive sprays during this period. For the cover sprays that start at shuck-off, copper can be used at 0.5 – 1.0 oz/A of metallic copper. This low rate can still cause phytotoxicity; however, it will be a tool that can be used with other products in rotation. Other products include the antibiotic oxytetracycline (Mycoshield or FireLine), which helps suppress the development of the disease but does not eliminate it. Bacterial-based products (Serenade, Double Nickel) have shown utility in Pennsylvania when used in rotation with copper under conditions of low to moderate disease pressure. Including Regalia in rotation has shown efficacy, particularly for cultivars with moderate susceptibility. Because chemical control is uncertain, planting resistant cultivars appears to be the best long-term control strategy. If crop loss results from severe winter temperatures or early spring freezes, bacterial spot must still be managed on susceptible varieties during the season to prevent defoliation and inoculum buildup for the next season. When using copper during cover sprays, be mindful of conditions that will promote phytotoxicity, such as slow drying conditions, acidic spray mixtures, and tank mixing with foliar fertilizers or adjuvants."

Pepper Bacterial Spot,"Lesions can occur on leaf parts (leaflets and petiole) and fruit parts (fruit, peduncle, and calyx). Stems are also susceptible but usually the other foliage parts are infected to a greater degree. Positive diagnosis requires testing in a laboratory; however, certain symptoms, especially those on the fruit, are suggestive of bacterial spot.[2]

","Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria survives on tomato and pepper plants, seeds, and debris from infected plants as it cannot live in the soil for more than a few weeks.[5] The bacterium can also be found in association with wheat roots and some weed species which are both considered sources of inoculum as well as diseased tomato and pepper plants.[5] In cold climates, Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria infection is mostly caused by contaminated seed material, both on and inside of seeds.[7] If it survives on seeds, it will infect the cotyledons of the growing plant as it emerges from the seed coat. Internally infected seeds will produce diseased plants from the point of germination. Systemic symptoms such as wilting, yellowing, and dwarfing are not typical of plants infected at the point of germination. However, foliage loss can happen when localized symptoms on leaves become severe. If the bacterium survives on debris, it may infect healthy plants through stomata as well as wounds on leaves and fruit. It is spread by direct contact of plants with debris, human movement of the bacteria from debris to plants, and can easily travel from debris to healthy plants through saturated soils via water movement. Once infected, plants begin to develop lesions on the leaves as well as fruit, becoming inoculum sources for further infection.

",,"Bacterial spot of pepper and tomato can spread extremely quickly with infected plants showing symptoms 3–5 days after exposure to the pathogen.[5] Starting with one infected plant, susceptible neighboring plants can show symptoms in as little as two weeks and an entire field can become diseased in as little as ten weeks.[8] There are currently several methods of control, some of which are more effective than others.

In the 1950s, the antibiotic streptomycin was used extensively to control the spread of Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria. However, the bacteria developed resistant strains and widespread antibiotic application is no longer an effective method of control.[9]

It was once believed that a single strain of Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria was responsible for leaf spot disease on peppers and tomatoes. However, it is now known that there are four different phenotypic groups within the Xanthomonas genus that are pathogenic.[10] Group A and C are found in Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, group B is found in X. vesicatoria, and group D is found in X. gardeneri.[10] Some of the strains have as little as 70% of their DNA in common which makes breeding for resistance extremely difficult. While there has been some research made into finding resistant varieties of host plants, success has been limited due to the variation in the pathogen

Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria does not survive well in decayed plant material therefore removal of debris and crop rotation are two good methods for preventing the spread of this bacterium. Another important management method is to eliminate volunteer plants (plants that grow without being specifically planted or managed by farmers) as wild pepper and tomato plants can harbor the disease in warmer climates.[5]

Currently, the most effective treatment for bacterial spot of pepper and tomato is a combination of chemical applications. Diseased seeds may be treated with sodium hypochlorite, calcium hypochlorite, or trisodium phosphate to kill bacteria on the surface of the seed.[5] Treating internal seed infection is harder but can be done with other chemical or heat treatments. Infected fields are treated with multiple application approach involving spraying a mixture of copper and mancozeb, which prevents further infection and kills a variety of pathogens present at the time of spraying.[9] Finally, there is some research being done into the foliar application of bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) to control the disease but this approach has been met with some resistance and is not currently a widely used method.[9]

","We do not recommend that growers save their own pepper seed. They should never save seed from hybrid varieties. The natural crossing of peppers is higher than that of tomatoes (usually less than 10% but as high as 25% in extreme cases). Isolation by distance (several hundred feet) and location upwind should be sufficient.

The flesh of mature peppers is relatively dry so that wet fermentation as used with tomato seeds is not necessary. Most of the seed exposed on the central core can be removed by cutting away the outer shell. Remember to use rubber gloves when working with hot peppers and avoid contact with your eyes. Pepper seed dries quickly when spread in a shallow layer. Do not save seed from a field known to have or suspected of having bacterial spot. Following harvest, pepper seed may be treated in one of two ways: (1) Soak the seeds for 30 minutes in a 10% solution of household bleach (0.525% sodium hypochlorite, NaOCI). (2) A hot water soak for pepper seed has long been recommended. Soak seeds at 125° F (51 ° C) for 30 minutes. The temperature and length of treatment are important; so monitor temperature with a good dairy or laboratory thermometer and keep the water bath agitated. The seed may be held in loosely woven cheesecloth bags not over one-half full to aid in handling. After treatment, dip the bag in cold water to stop the heat treatment. Spread the seeds out to dry and apply a protective seed-treatment fungicide such as thiram. Freshly harvested seed withstand the heat treatment better than do 1- or 2-year old seed.

Potato Early Blight,"Alternaria solani infects stems, leaves and fruits of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), potato (S. tuberosum), eggplant (S. melongena L.), bell pepper and hot pepper (Capsicum spp.), and other members of the family Solanaceae.[5] Distinguishing symptoms of A. solani include leaf spot and defoliation, which are most pronounced in the lower canopy. In some cases, A. solani may also cause damping off.[6][7]

On tomatoes
On tomato, foliar symptoms of A. solani generally occur on the oldest leaves and start as small lesions that are brown to black in color. These leaf spots resemble concentric rings - a distinguishing characteristic of the pathogen - and measure up to 1.3 cm (0.51 inches) in diameter.[8] Both the area around the leaf spot and the entire leaf may become yellow or chlorotic. Under favorable conditions (e.g., warm weather with short or abundant dews), significant defoliation of lower leaves may occur, leading to sunscald of the fruit.[8] As the disease progresses, symptoms may migrate to the plant stem and fruit. Stem lesions are dark, slightly sunken and concentric in shape. Basal girdling and death of seedlings may occur, a symptom known as collar rot.[8] In fruit, A. solani invades at the point of attachment to the stem as well as through growth cracks and wounds made by insects, infecting large areas of the fruit[8] Fruit spots are similar in appearance to those on leaves – brown with dark concentric circles. Mature lesions are typically covered by a black, velvety mass of fungal spores that may be visible under proper light conditions.[5][8]

In potato, primary damage by A. solani is attributed to premature defoliation of potato plants, which results in tuber yield reduction. Initial infection occurs on older leaves, with concentric dark brown spots developing mainly in the leaf center. The disease progresses during the period of potato vegetation, and infected leaves turn yellow and either dry out or fall off the stem. On stems, spots are gaunt with no clear contours (as compared to leaf spots). Tuber lesions are dry, dark and pressed into the tuber surface, with the underlying flesh turning dry, leathery and brown. During storage, tuber lesions may enlarge and tubers may become shriveled.[9] Disease severity due to A. solani is highest when potato plants are injured, under stress or lack proper nutrition. High levels of nitrogen, moderate potassium and low phosphorus in the soil can reduce susceptibility of infection by the pathogen.[2]","Alternaria solani is a deuteromycete[10] with a polycyclic life cycle. Alternaria solani reproduces asexually by means of conidia. A.solani is generally considered to be a necrotrophic pathogen, i.e. it kills the host tissue using cell wall degrading enzymes and toxins and feeds on the dead plant cell material [11]

The life cycle starts with the fungus overwintering in crop residues or wild members of the family Solanaceae, such as black nightshade.[12] In the spring, conidia are produced. Multicellular conidia are splashed by water or by wind onto an uninfected plant. The conidia infect the plant by entering through small wounds, stomata, or direct penetration. Infections usually start on older leaves close to the ground. The fungus takes time to grow and eventually forms a lesion. From this lesion, more conidia are created and released. These conidia infect other plants or other parts of the same plant within the same growing season. Every part of the plant can be infected and form lesions. This is especially important when fruit or tubers are infected as they can be used to spread the disease.[13]

In general, development of the pathogen can be aggravated by an increase in inoculum from alternative hosts such as weeds or other solanaceous species.[2] Disease severity and prevalence are highest when plants are mature.[8]

",,"Clear infected debris from field to reduce inoculum for the next year.
Water plants in the morning so plants are wet for the shortest amount of time.
Use a drip irrigation system to minimize leaf wetness which provides optimal conditions for fungal growth.
Use mulch so spores in soil cannot splash onto leaves from the soil.
Rotate to a non-Solanaceous crop for at least three years. The more potato-free years, the less infection.
If possible control wild population of Solanaceae. This will decrease the amount of inoculum to infect your plants.
Closely monitor field, especially in warm damp weather when it grows fastest, to reduce loss of crop and spray fungicide in time.
Plant resistant cultivars.
Increase air circulation in rows. Damp conditions allow for optimal growth of A. Solani and the disease spreads more rapidly. This can be achieved by planting farther apart or by trimming leaves.[13]
[15] Chemical control
There are numerous fungicides on the market for controlling early blight. Some of the fungicides on the market are (azoxystrobin), pyraclostrobin, Bacillus subtilis, chlorothalonil, copper products, hydrogen dioxide (Hydroperoxyl), mancozeb, potassium bicarbonate, and ziram.[14] Specific spraying regiments are found on the label. Labels for these products should be read carefully before applying. Quinone outside inhibitor (QoIs) fungicides e.g. azoxystrobin are used due to their broad-spectrum activity. However, decreased fungicide sensitivity has been observed in A. solanidue to a F129L (Phenylalanine (F) changed to Leucine at position 129) amino acid substitution.[16]

","The spores and mycelia of the pathogen survive in infested plant debris and soil, in infected tubers and in overwintering host crops and weeds. Spores are produced when temperatures are between 41-86 F. (5-30 C.) with alternating periods of wetness and dryness. These spores are then spread through wind, splashing rain, and irrigation water. They gain entry via wounds caused by mechanical injury or insect feeding. Lesions begin to appear 2-3 days after the initial infection. Treatment of early blight includes prevention by planting potato varieties that are resistant to the disease; late maturing are more resistant than early maturing varieties. Avoid overhead irrigation and allow for sufficient aeration between plants to allow the foliage to dry as quickly as possible. Practice a 2-year crop rotation. That is, do not replant potatoes or other crops in this family for 2 years after a potato crop has been harvested. Keep the potato plants healthy and stress free by providing adequate nutrition and sufficient irrigation, especially later in the growing season after flowering when plants are most susceptible to the disease. Only dig the tubers up when they are completely mature to prevent from damaging them. Any damage done at harvest can additionally facilitate the disease."

Potato Late Blight,"Late blight is caused by the water mould Phytophthora infestans. Though water moulds (or oomycetes) look similar to fungi, they are more closely related to algae. As a consequence late blight spores require water to germinate and penetrate host plant tissues. Early signs of late blight infection are small flecks on infected leaves and plant stems. These grow into larger lesions. Infected tissue is initially water soaked (grey-green), then necrotic (brown or black) with firm, rough surfaces (Figure 2). Lesions are often enclosed by a halo of lighter green tissue. In humid weather white mould (or “fuzz”) grows under the leaves and infected plants suddenly collapse. Infected potato tubers have brown to purple skin lesions that are dark, reddish brown underneath (Figure 3). They have an uneven, corky, dry rot inside and can become a foul-smelling mush if infected by secondary bacterial soft rots.","The Phytophthora infestans lifecycle alternates between mould growth and spore production. The asexual spore stage produces millions of thin-walled spores called sporangia. Each sporangia creates 20-40 thin-walled spores named zoospores. The sexual spore stage occurs inside plant material between the A1 and A2 mating types of sporangia and produces thick-walled spores called oospores. Sporangia and zoospores are short-lived spores in plant debris or soil. They are killed by frosts and hot weather. Sporangia inside potato tubers and oospores may live for many years. The late blight lifecycle is completed under ideal conditions in five days, if the air temperatures remain above 10°C and humidity is over 75% for two consecutive days.",,"Do not plant potato tubers from the previous year; purchase seed potatoes from a reputable source and inspect them before planting. Destroy volunteer potatoes that sprout from overwintered tubers. The late blight organism requires living tissue to survive; it does not survive in the soil or carried tomato seed. The most likely source of late blight is infected potato tubers that survived the winter, tubers that were saved, or tubers that remained in the soil unfrozen and grow from overwintered tubers as volunteer potato plants. These plants should be dug up, placed in a plastic bag and discarded in the trash or completely buried deep enough so plants decompose and will not resprout. Select resistant varieties were available. ‘Mountain Magic’, ‘Legend’, and ‘Plum Regal’ have excellent resistance to Late Blight. ‘Red Pearl’ and ‘Matt’s Wild Cherry’ are small fruited tomatoes with good resistance. Some heirloom tomato varieties have good tolerance to late blight. A few cultivars also have resistance to Early Blight (Alternaria solani, A. tomatophila) and should be considered. The development of triple (LB, EB, Septoria leaf spot) resistant varieties is underway at Cornell and other Universities.

Growing your own tomato transplants from seed or purchasing transplants that were started here in the Northeast from seed will ensure a healthy start to the season for you and local farms. Control solanaceous weeds such as hairy nightshade, jimson weed, golden henbane, and others. Plant potatoes and tomatoes where air circulation is good; stake tomatoes for more rapid dying of leaves after dew or rainfall. If symptoms are already appearing on plants, remove plants, place in a plastic bag, seal and discard in the trash or completely bury plants deep enough underground so plants decompose and will not re-sprout. Do not put the plants in a compost pile as spores will still spread from this debris.","To manage late blight with fungicides, treat before symptoms appear. Use a product that contains chlorothalonil listed as the active ingredient on the label. There are ready- to- use formulations available to home gardeners. Fungicides are only effective if used before the disease appears and should be reapplied every 5-7 days if wet weather persists. Chlorothalonil is a protectant fungicide, with no systemic movement in the plant, so thorough coverage is necessary. Copper based fungicides are another option for home gardeners, and are reasonably effective against some strains of the late blight fungus. For organic gardeners, copper based fungicides are the only allowed option. As with all pesticides, read the label carefully and follow instructions for personal protective clothing, rates, and interval between spraying and harvest. These fungicides will also reduce losses from early blight and Septoria leaf spot, which are widespread in gardens and on farms every year from July till frost. If late blight is widespread in the region and weather conditions are favorable for the disease, fungicides alone may not guarantee a healthy crop."

Squash Powdery Mildew,"White deposits develop on the top sides of leaves that make them look like they have been dusted with flour. As this fungal disease advances, leaves become grayish-green and become dry to the touch. Eventually these leaves turn brown and fall off. Powdery mildew is most likely to infect older plants that are beginning to decline after producing a crop. Warm temperatures between 70 and 80F (21 to 27C) favor cucurbit powdery mildew, but rainy weather is not required to trigger an outbreak. Powdery mildew fungi clog up leaf pores and block light to photosynthetic cells, so the plants are weakened in their ability to use light as an energy source. New growth stops, old leaves fall off, and the plants struggle to stay alive. Pumpkins or winter squash produced by mildewed plants may lack flavor, and quickly lose quality in storage.",,,"Use resistant varieties when they are available. Thin plants to proper spacing so each leaf gets good exposure to sun and fresh air. Plant fast-growing varieties of summer squash to sidestep this disease. Starting in early summer, spray plants every 10 days with a mixture of one part milk (any kind) to four parts water.","If your plants do develop powdery mildew despite your best efforts, don’t worry. There are many environmentally friendly options for eliminating the disease, including: Baking Soda. Baking soda itself isn’t normally effective as a powdery mildew treatment, but when it’s combined with liquid soap and water, it can be a powerful weapon. It’s normally most beneficial if used as a preventative measure rather than a treatment. Combine one tablespoon baking soda and one-half teaspoon of liquid, non-detergent soap with one gallon of water, and spray the mixture liberally on the plants. Mouthwash. The mouthwash you may use on a daily basis for killing the germs in your mouth can also be effective at killing powdery mildew spores. Since its function is to kill germs, the powdery mildew spores can’t withstand it. Using three parts water to one part mouthwash has been found to be a good ratio, but new growth can be damaged since mouthwash is potent, so use with caution. Milk. Milk is making its way onto the scene as a viable means to control powdery mildew. Not all the science is known, but the compounds in milk may be able to act as an antiseptic and fungicide as well as potentially increase the plant’s overall immunity. It tends to be effective as a method of preventing powdery mildew on zucchini and other types of squash, as well as cucumbers. An effective mixture ratio is about one part milk to two or three parts water. Organic Fungicide Treatments. If you don’t want a do-it-yourself solution, there is a variety of commercial treatment options that are just as environmentally friendly and approved for organic gardening. By going this route, you also know exactly what types of pests the treatment will kill and which types of plants it’s most helpful for. Water. Since dry conditions coupled with high humidity are often the culprits behind powdery mildew growth, watering your plants overhead and getting the entire plant wet can help. However, it’s important to use this method somewhat sparingly as overwatering can cause other issues for your plants."

Strawberry Leaf Scorch,"Leaf scorch symptoms are very similar to the early stages of common (Mycosphaerella) leaf spot, with irregular dark purple spots being scattered over the upper leaf surface. As the spots enlarge, they begin to look like drops of tar, and are actually the accumulations of black fruiting bodies (acervuli) of the fungus. The centers of the spots remain purple (in Mycosphaerella leaf spot they are white) and there is no well-defined lesion border. In heavy infections, these regions coalesce and the tissue between the lesions often takes on a purplish to bright red color that is dependent on cultivar, temperature, or other factors. The leaves eventually turn brown, dry up, and curl at the margins giving the leaf a scorched appearance. Examination of the acervuli and conidial morphology can help to distinguish between leaf spot and leaf scorch at this advanced stage of disease. On the upper leaf surfaces of leaf scorch lesions, the acervuli are dark with glistening spore masses and dark apothecia. Petiole lesions are elongate, sunken, with a purplish to brown color and can kill the leaf by girdling the petiole. Runners, fruit stalks, fruit and caps can also become infected. Plants may become weakened and the number and vigor of crowns reduced. Infection predisposes the plants to winter and drought stress. In severe infestations, flowers and fruit may die. Overall, there can be a serious reduction in yield in matted row systems. It has not been observed as a yield-reducing problem in annual production systems.","In annual production systems, the disease can come on transplants or tips and build up in the plug production phase in the early fall in the field. However, the pathogen does not cause damage the following spring. In the matted row system, the population can build up to damaging levels. Spores are produced in the spring and midsummer on lower leaf surfaces of dead leaves infected in the previous year, and are spread by wind and splashing rain. Disease increase is favored by leaf wetness during warm weather (68-86°F), and is likely to become more significant on older plantings of susceptible varieties. One ascospore generation (the starting sproes) and several overlapping generations of conidia (spores) are produced every year. Apothecia, a small mushroom-like structure, generally form on infected leaves in the fall and forcibly discharge ascospores, which are wind dispersed, in the springtime. Acervuli are found throughout the season in lesions or on residue of the foliage. Under dry conditions the acervuli can go into dormancy, but once moist conditions return, they again become active and exude conidia in a sticky mass. The conidia are disseminated to new infection sites where they directly penetrate and grow intercellularly.",,"In matted row or perennial strawberry systems, select a planting site with good air drainage and sun exposure. Cultivars resistant to leaf scorch may be available and need to be evaluated for specific horticultural characteristics. Plant new transplants frequently, and allow adequate spacing between them to increase airflow. Control weeds. Avoid amendment with supplemental nitrogen in spring, as this may enhance disease. Keep moisture levels down and avoid long wetness periods by monitoring irrigation schedules; if possible, use drip irrigation rather than overhead. Remove foliage and crop residues after picking or at renovation to remove inoculum and delay disease increase in late summer and fall. Fungicide treatments are effective during the flowering period, and during late summer and fall. In annual plasticulture production systems, the disease has not been observed to cause economic damage in fruiting fields and generally does not require action. Although symptoms may be on plants at the time of planting or soon after, the levels of disease are typically low and do not persist into the spring. In plug production facilities, high disease levels may affect the look of the plants and this decreased aesthetic value may impact sales. See our Strawberry IPM Guide at for current recommendations.","While leaf scorch on strawberry plants can be frustrating, there are some strategies which home gardeners may employ to help prevent its spread in the garden. The primary means of strawberry leaf scorch control should always be prevention. Since this fungal pathogen over winters on the fallen leaves of infect plants, proper garden sanitation is key. This includes the removal of infected garden debris from the strawberry patch, as well as the frequent establishment of new strawberry transplants. The creation of new plantings and strawberry patches is key to maintaining a consistent strawberry harvest, as older plants are more likely to show signs of severe infection."
Tomato Bacterial Spot,"Bacterial spot can affect all above ground parts of a tomato plant, including the leaves, stems, and fruit.  Bacterial spot appears on leaves as small (less than ⅛ inch), sometimes water-soaked (i.e., wet-looking) circular areas.  Spots may initially be yellow-green, but darken to brownish-red as they age.  When the disease is severe, extensive leaf yellowing and leaf loss can also occur.  On green fruit, spots are typically small, raised and blister-like, and may have a yellowish halo.  As fruit mature, the spots enlarge (reaching a maximum size of ¼ inch) and turn brown, scabby and rough.  Mature spots may be raised, or sunken with raised edges.  Bacterial spot symptoms can be easily confused with symptoms of another tomato disease called bacterial speck.  For more information on this disease, see University of Wisconsin Garden Facts XHT1250.",,,"Plant pathogen-free seed or transplants to prevent the introduction of bacterial spot pathogens on contaminated seed or seedlings.  If a clean seed source is not available or you suspect that your seed is contaminated, soak seeds in water at 122°F for 25 min. to kill the pathogens.  To keep leaves dry and to prevent the spread of the pathogens, avoid overhead watering (e.g., with a wand or sprinkler) of established plants and instead use a drip-tape or soaker-hose.  Also to prevent spread, DO NOT handle plants when they are wet (e.g., from dew) and routinely sterilize tools with either 10% bleach solution or (better) 70% alcohol (e.g., rubbing alcohol).  Where bacterial spot has been a recurring problem, consider using preventative applications of copper-based products registered for use on tomato, especially during warm, wet periods.  Keep in mind however, that if used excessively or for prolonged periods, copper may no longer control the disease.  Be sure to read and follow all label instructions of the product that you select to ensure that you use it in the safest and most effective manner possible.  Burn, bury or hot compost tomato debris at the end of the season.  Wait at least one year before planting tomatoes in a given location again, and remove and burn, bury or hot compost any volunteer tomatoes that come up in your garden.","A plant with bacterial spot cannot be cured.  Remove symptomatic plants from the field or greenhouse to prevent the spread of bacteria to healthy plants.  Burn, bury or hot compost the affected plants and DO NOT eat symptomatic fruit.  Although bacterial spot pathogens are not human pathogens, the fruit blemishes that they cause can provide entry points for human pathogens that could cause illness."
Tomato Early Blight,"Early blight is sometimes confused with Septoria leaf spot. They both form spots on the leaves, which eventually turn yellow and die off, but Septoria also forms fruiting bodies that look like tiny filaments coming from the spots. On Older Plants: Dark spots with concentric rings develop on older leaves first. The surrounding leaf area may turn yellow. Affected leaves may die prematurely, exposing the fruits to sun scald. Dark lesions on the stems start off small and slightly sunken. As they get larger, they elongate and you will start to see concentric markings like the spots on the leaves. Spots that form near ground level can cause some girdling of the stem or collar rot. Plants may survive, but they will not thrive or produce many tomatoes. On Tomato Fruits: If early blight gets on the fruits, spots will begin at the stem end, forming a dark, leathery, sunken area with concentric rings. Both green and ripe tomatoes can be affected. On Seedlings: Affected seedlings will have dark spots on their leaves and stems. They may even develop the disease on their cotyledon leaves. Stems often wind up girdled.","The lower leaves become infected via contaminated soil – either from direct contact or from rain splashing fungal spores onto the plant. Flea beetles sometimes transmit the pathogen as well as they travel from plant to plant. The fungal spores require free water, such as rain or heavy dew, or at least 90% humidity to germinate. They are not very fussy about temperature, and will germinate in a wide range of temperatures, from 47 to 90°F. After the spores have germinated, lesions can form on infected plants in as little as five days. When the spores are present in a garden or field, they can be spread by wind, equipment, insect pests, or human contact.",,"All of these varieties are somewhat resistant to early blight, but none is completely immune. Aunt Ginny's Purple - Heirloom, indeterminate, beefsteak (16 oz.) Big Rainbow - Heirloom, indeterminate, bi-color beefsteak (16 oz.) Black Plum - Heirloom, indeterminate, plum (2 in.) Juliet - Hybrid, indeterminate, cherry (1 ounce) Legend - Open-pollinated, determinate, beefsteak (14-16 ounces) Manyel - Heirloom, indeterminate, yellow globe (8-10 ounces) Matt’s Wild Cherry - Heirloom, indeterminate, cherry (1/2 inch) Mountain Supreme - Hybrid, determinate, globe (6-8 oz.) Mountain Fresh Plus - Hybrid, determinate, globe (12 ounces) Old Brooks - Heirloom, indeterminate, globe (6-8 ounces) Tigerella (aka Mr. Stripey) - Heirloom, indeterminate, globe (4-6 oz.) Tommy Toe - Heirloom, indeterminate, cherry (1 inch)","Tomatoes that have early blight require immediate attention before the disease takes over the plants. Thoroughly spray the plant (bottoms of leaves also) with Bonide Liquid Copper Fungicide concentrate or Bonide Tomato & Vegetable. Both of these treatments are organic. If possible time applications so that 12 hours of dry weather follows applications. A day after treatment, remove the lower branches with sharp razor blade knife. Clean your knife with rubbing alcohol before trimming the next plant to prevent the spread of the disease. Repeat fungicide treatments every 7 to 14 days. Read the label instructions carefully. Do not spray pesticides, fungicides, fertilizers or herbicides when it’s in the high 80’s or 90; you can damage your plants. Water your plants the day before spraying, hydration is important!"
Tomato Healthy,,,,,
Tomato Late Blight,"The first symptoms of late blight on tomato leaves are irregularly shaped, water-soaked lesions, often with a lighter halo or ring around them (Figure 1); these lesions are typically found on the younger, more succulent leaves in the top portion of the plant canopy. During high humidity, white cottony growth may be visible on underside of the leaf (Figure 2), where sporangia form (Figure 3 and Figure 5). Spots are visible on both sides of the leaves. As the disease progresses, lesions enlarge causing leaves to brown, shrivel and die. Late blight can also attack tomato fruit in all stages of development. Rotted fruit are typically firm with greasy spots that eventually become leathery and chocolate brown in color (Figure 4); these spots can enlarge to the point of encompassing the entire fruit. Look alike diseases: Other species of Phytophthora, specifically P. nicotianae and P. capsici, can also cause lesions on tomato and tomato fruit similar to those caused by late blight. However, these two species are soilborne (as opposed to ariborne) and typically only cause disease after the plants have been flooeded or if the plant had been in contact with wet soil. Late blight can be differentiated from early blight on tomato and other foliar fungal diseases by where they occur on the plant. Lesions caused by late blight can be found anywhere on the plant, but are mostly found on the new growth whereas early blight typically starts on the lower leaves and slowly moves up the plant. Also, lesions caused by late blight tend to be light brown or tan in color while lesions caused by early blight tend to be dark brown in color with concentric rings.",,,"The USA Blight web site tracks the occurance of late blight in real time. Check the site regularly during the growing season. When late blight is detected in your region, consider a weekly prevetative spray. Cornell plant pathologist Meg McGrath suggests using Actinovate (which contains the beneficial bacteria Streptomyces lydicus) as a preventative spray, and adding a copper-based product when late blight is present. Remember that while these sprays can help reduce the likelihood of infection, you still need to monitor plants closely.","If symptoms are observed, treat plants with one of the following fungicides: Apply a copper based fungicide (2 oz/ gallon of water) every 7 days or less, following heavy rain or when the amount of disease is increasing rapidly. If possible, time applications so that at least 12 hours of dry weather follows application. Used as a foliar spray, Organocide® Plant Doctor will work its way through the entire plant to prevent fungal problems from occurring and attack existing many problems. Mix 2 tsp/ gallon of water and spray at transplant or when direct seeded crops are at 2-4 true leaf, then at 1-2 week intervals as required to control disease. Safely treat fungal problems with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis and is approved for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects. Monterey® All Natural Disease Control is a ready-to-use blend of naturally occurring ingredients that control most plant foliar diseases. All stages of the disease is controlled, but applying before infestation gives the best results."
Tomato Leaf Mold,"Leaf mold of tomato is caused by pathogen Passalora fulva. It is found throughout the world, predominantly on tomatoes grown where the relative humidity is high, particularly in plastic greenhouses. Occasionally, if conditions are just right, leaf mold of tomato can be a problem on field grown fruit. Symptoms start as pale green to yellowish spots on upper leaf surfaces that turn a bright yellow. The spots merge as the disease progresses and the foliage then dies. Infected leaves curl, wither, and often drop from the plant. Flowers, stems, and fruit may be infected, although usually only leaf tissue is affected. When the disease does manifest on the fruit, tomatoes with leaf mold become dark in color, leathery, and rot at the stem end.",,,"High relative humidity (greater that 85%) combined with high temperatures encourages the spread of the disease. With that in mind, if growing tomatoes in a greenhouse, maintain night temps higher than outside temperatures. When planting, use only certified disease-free seed or treated seed. Remove and destroy all crop debris post-harvest. Sanitize the greenhouse between crop seasons. Use fans and avoid overhead watering to minimize leaf wetness. Also, stake and prune plants to increase ventilation. If the disease is detected, apply a fungicide according to the manufacturer’s instructions at the first sign of infection.","When treating tomato plants with fungicide, be sure to cover all areas of the plant that are above the soil, especially the underside of leaves, where the disease often forms. Calcium chloride-based sprays are recommended for treating leaf mold issues. Organic fungicide options are also available."
Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot,"Septoria leaf spot usually appears on the lower leaves after the first fruit sets. Spots are circular, about 1/16 to 1/4 inch in diameter with dark brown margins and tan to gray centers with small black fruiting structures. Characteristically, there are many spots per leaf. This disease spreads upwards from oldest to youngest growth. If leaf lesions are numerous, the leaves turn slightly yellow, then brown, and then wither. Fruit infection is rare.","The fungus overwinters on infected tomato debris or on weeds in the nightshade family, the same family to which tomatoes belong. The fungus can also survive on equipment such as plant stakes and cages. Long periods of high relative humidity, temperatures of 60–80 degrees F, and leaf wetness are ideal conditions for development and spread of the pathogen.",,"Use disease-free seed. There's no evidence that it is carried by seeds, but err on the safe side and don't save seed from infected plants. Thoroughly processing the tomato seeds you are saving will also help rid the seeds of lingering diseases.
Start with a clean garden. Dispose of all affected plants. The fungus can over-winter on the debris of diseased plants. It's important to dispose of all the affected plants far away from the garden and the compost pile. Keep in mind that it may have spread to your potatoes and eggplants, too.
Avoid overhead watering. Water aids the spread of Septoria leaf spot. Keep it off the leaves as much as possible by watering at the base of the plant only. Of course, it's impossible to keep the rain off your plants, but every little bit helps.
Provide room for air circulation. Leave some space between your tomato plants so there is good airflow. Stake them so that they are not touching the ground and not all bunched together. Good air circulation is especially important during damp and rainy periods.
Mulch below the plants. A layer of mulch will help prevent spores on the ground from splashing up onto the lower leaves.
Plant next year's tomatoes in a different section of your garden. In small gardens, it's not always practical to rotate your crops, so good clean up and sanitation become even more important.","Removing infected leaves. Remove infected leaves immediately, and be sure to wash your hands and pruners thoroughly before working with uninfected plants. Consider organic fungicide options. Fungicides containing either copper or potassium bicarbonate will help prevent the spreading of the disease. Begin spraying as soon as the first symptoms appear and follow the label directions for continued management. Consider chemical fungicides. While chemical options are not ideal, they may be the only option for controlling advanced infections. One of the least toxic and most effective is chlorothalonil (sold under the names Fungonil and Daconil)."
Tomato Spider Mites Two-Spotted Spider Mite,"The two-spotted spider mite is the most common mite species that attacks vegetable and fruit crops in New England. Spider mites can occur in tomato, eggplant, potato, vine crops such as melons, cucumbers, and other crops. Two-spotted spider mites are one of the most important pests of eggplant. They have up to 20 generations per year and are favored by excess nitrogen and dry and dusty conditions. Outbreaks are often caused by the use of broad-spectrum insecticides which interfere with the numerous natural enemies that help to manage mite populations. As with most pests, catching the problem early will mean easier control.","Eggs are laid singly, up to 100 per female, during her 3- to 4-week life span. Eggs hatch into larvae in as few as 3 days. Following a brief larval stage, several nymphal stages occur before adults appear. Egg to adult cycle can be completed in 7-14 days depending on temperature.",,"Watch for spider mites in greenhouses where vegetable transplants are growing. Also scout eggplants in the field. Checking for mites must be done by examining foliage. Adult mites are not found on sticky cards. Mites often develop as localized infestations on particular groups of plants such as beans or tomatoes. Sample plants by turning over leaves and with a hands-free magnifier (Optivisor) or hand lens, check for the presence of spider mites as well as symptoms or webbing. Adult females are approximately 1/50-inch long, slightly orange or pale green in color with two dark spots on their body. All mobile stages are able to pierce plant tissue with their mouth-parts and remove plant fluids. Saliva injected during feeding may also cause discoloration, necrosis or abnormalities on leaves, stems and fruits. Most spider mites are found on the underside of leaves. A 10X hand lens is key for identifying the mite species, but injury, webbing, and the tiny adults can be seen with the naked eye.","Preventative releases of the predatory mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis, may suppress TSSM populations in greenhousese and vegetable fields, as they do in strawberry fields. Amblyseius fallicis is a predatory mite that is widely used in greenhouses. See New England Vegetable Guide on biological control in greenhouse bedding plants, Table 25. Scouting guidelines and biological control options for bedding plants. For control, use selective products whenever possible. Selective products which have worked well in the field include:

bifenazate (Acramite): Group UN, a long residual nerve poison
abamectin (Agri-Mek): Group 6, derived from a soil bacterium
spirotetramat (Movento): Group 23, mainly affects immature stages
spiromesifen (Oberon 2SC): Group 23, mainly affects immature stages
OMRI-listed products include:

insecticidal soap (M-Pede)
neem oil (Trilogy)
soybean oil (Golden Pest Spray Oil)
With most miticides (excluding bifenazate), make 2 applications, approximately 5-7 days apart, to help control immature mites that were in the egg stage and protected during the first application. Alternate between products after 2 applications to help prevent or delay resistance. For current information on production methods (including varieties, spacing, seeding, and fertility), weed, disease, and insect management, please visit the New England Vegetable Management Guide.

Tomato Target Spot,"The disease starts on the older leaves and spreads upwards. The first signs are irregular-shaped spots (less than 1 mm) with a yellow margin (Photo 1). Some of the spots enlarge up to 10 mm and show characteristics rings, hence the name of ""target spot"" (larger spots Photos 1&2). Spread to all leaflets and to other leaves is rapid (Photo 3), causing the leaves to turn yellow, collapse and die (Photo 4). Spots also occur on the stems. They are long and thin. Small light brown spots with dark margins may also occur on the fruit.",,Look for the disease on the bottom leaves. Look for tiny brown spots with yellow margins. Look for larger spots up to 10 mm that have ring patterns. Spots may be present on the stems and on the fruit.,"Preventive treatment is a great way to manage the risk of early blight and target spot in your tomato yields. Miravis® Prime fungicide contains 2 chemistries, fludioxonil and Adepidyn® fungicide, to help treat tough diseases in fruiting vegetables. The 2 powerful active ingredients offer strong disease control that evenly distributes on leaf surfaces to protect against target spot, early blight and many other tomato and fruiting vegetable diseases.","Target spot tomato treatment requires a multi-pronged approach. The following tips for treating target spot on tomatoes should help: Remove old plant debris at the end of the growing season; otherwise, the spores will travel from debris to newly planted tomatoes in the following growing season, thus beginning the disease anew. Dispose of the debris properly and don’t place it on your compost pile unless you’re sure your compost gets hot enough to kill the spores. Rotate crops and don’t plant tomatoes in areas where other disease-prone plants have been located in the past year– primarily eggplant, peppers, potatoes or, of course– tomatoes. Rutgers University Extension recommends a three year rotation cycle to reduce soil-borne fungi. Pay careful attention to air circulation, as target spot of tomato thrives in humid conditions. Grow the plants in full sunlight. Be sure the plants aren’t crowded and that each tomato has plenty of air circulation. Cage or stake tomato plants to keep the plants above the soil. Water tomato plants in the morning so the leaves have time to dry. Water at the base of the plant or use a soaker hose or drip system to keep the leaves dry. Apply a mulch to keep the fruit from coming in direct contact with the soil. Limit mulch to 3 inches (8 cm.) or less if your plants are bothered by slugs or snails."
Tomato Mosaic Virus,"The foliage of affected tomato plants shows mottling, with alternating yellowish and darker green areas, the latter often appearing thicker and raised giving a blister-like appearance. The leaves tend to be fern-like in appearance with pointed tips and younger leaves may be twisted. The fruit may be distorted, yellow blotches and necrotic spots may occur on both ripe and green fruit and there may be internal browning of the fruit wall. In young plants, the infection reduces the set of fruit and may cause distortions and blemishes. The entire plant may be dwarfed and the flowers discoloured.[1] Environmental conditions influence the symptoms. These include temperature, day length and light intensity as well as the variety, the age of the plant at infection and the virulence of the strain of ToMV.[2]
","The virus may be introduced on infected seed. Only a small number of seedlings need to be infected for the virus to spread rapidly. It can also be spread on contaminated tools and the clothing and hands of workers during routine activities.[2]
",,"Tomato mosaic virus of tomatoes can exist in the soil or plant debris for up to two years, and can be spread just by touch – a gardener who touches or even brushes up against an infected plant can carry the infection for the rest of the day.  You should wash your hands with soap and disinfect tools after handling tomato plants to keep the disease from spreading. Treating mosaic virus is difficult and there are no chemical controls like there are for fungal diseases, although some varieties of tomato are resistant to the disease, and seeds can be bought that are certified disease free. Sanitation is the most important application to practice when controlling tobacco mosaic virus. Tools should be boiled for 5 minutes and then washed with a strong detergent. Bleaching doesn’t work for viral decontamination. Destroy any seedlings that appear stunted or distorted and then decontaminate tools and hands.","Keep the area around the tomatoes weeded and free of plant detritus to minimize areas the disease can harbor. Control insects as well to lessen the chances of contamination. If you spot the disease in your garden, you should immediately dig up and burn infected plants. Don’t plant tomatoes, cucumbers or other plants that are susceptible to mosaic virus in that same area again."
Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus,"Infected tomato plants initially show stunted and erect or upright plant growth; plants infected at an early stage of growth will show severe stunting. However, the most diagnostic symptoms are those in leaves.

Leaves of infected plants are small and curl upward; and show strong crumpling and interveinal and marginal yellowing. The internodes of infected plants become shortened and, together with the stunted growth, plants often take on a bushy appearance, which is sometimes referred to as 'bonsai' or broccoli'-like growth. Flowers formed on infected plants commonly do not develop and fall off (abscise). Fruit production is dramatically reduced, particularly when plants are infected at an early age, and it is not uncommon for losses of 100% to be experienced in fields with heavily infected plants.",,,Maintain good weed control in the field and surrounding areas. Prevent the spread of any whiteflies to healthy plants. Tomato and pepper fields should be cleaned up immediately after harvest. Also destroy crop residues of melons and cotton immediately after harvest to reduce whitefly migration.,"Currently, the most effective treatments used to control the spread of TYLCV are insecticides and resistant crop varieties. The effectiveness of insecticides is not optimal in tropical areas due to whitefly resistance against the insecticides; therefore, insecticides should be alternated or mixed to provide the most effective treatment against virus transmission.[6] Developing countries experience the most significant losses due to TYLCV infections due to the warm climate as well as the expensive costs of insecticides used as the control strategy. Other methods to control the spread of TYLCV include planting resistant/tolerant lines, crop rotation, and breeding for resistance of TYLCV. As with many other plant viruses, one of the most promising methods to control TYLCV is the production of transgenic tomato plants resistant to TYLCV.[1]"
